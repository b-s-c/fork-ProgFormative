i. Interest of content
	*Very good*
	* I found the content to be very interesting. On top of that, it covered a broad range of topics.


ii. Consistency and quality of visual presentation
	*Very good*
	* Apart from the issue with the hamburger menu (pt. iv), the website looks very nice and works great.
	* The "About the author" sections are inconsistent, and vary from page to page.


iii. Quality of written presentation
	*Very good*
	* As mentioned in pt. i, the content is high-quality and engaging. The layout is very nice, which also contributes to reader engagement.


iv. Validity of HTML
	*Very good*
	* The hamburger menu doesn't do anything (once you shrink the width of the window to show it), which prevents you from navigating the website.
	* While all of the pages work, the HTML validator still returns errors.

	Validity check:
	* AI.html: 1 warning, 6 errors
	* Template.html: 1 warning
	* automotive.html: 1 warning
	* datascience.html: 1 warning, 5 errors
	* finance.html: 1 warning, 10 errors
	* index.html: 1 warning, 1 error
	* medical_app.html: 1 warning, 11 errors


v. Evidence of collaboration
*Good*
* The author info is not written by the author of the given page.
* The contributions seem to be quite balanced.
* There is a big time gap between series of commits.
